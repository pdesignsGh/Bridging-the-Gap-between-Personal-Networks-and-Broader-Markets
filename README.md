# Bridging-the-Gap-between-Personal-Networks-and-Broader-Markets
This project aims to create a multivendor platform for student entrepreneurs, enabling them to sell goods and services to broader markets. Focused on affordability, easy-to-use features, and support for both physical and digital products, the platform helps students scale their businesses from personal networks.
